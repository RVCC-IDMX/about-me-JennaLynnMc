    <h2>You're Mine</h2>
    
    <p>I've begun to realize that whenever I am with you <br>
        You deliver me from the pain in my life<br>
        Easy now to recognize All the misery I have been through<br>
        It was beating me to submission Til' the day you arrived<br></p>

    <h2>An Excerpt From Sherlock Holmes</h2>
        <div>  
            <p>"Last Monday I had finished for the day and was dressing in my room above the opium den when I looked out of my window and saw, to my horror and astonishment, that my wife was standing in the street, with her eyes fixed full upon me. I gave a cry of surprise, threw up my arms to cover my face, and, rushing to my confidant, the Lascar, entreated him to prevent anyone from coming up to me. I heard her voice downstairs, but I knew that she could not ascend. Swiftly I threw off my clothes, pulled on those of a beggar, and put on my pigments and wig. Even a wife's eyes could not pierce so complete a disguise. But then it occurred to me that there might be a search in the room, and that the clothes might betray me. I threw open the window, reopening by my violence a small cut which I had inflicted upon myself in the bedroom that morning. Then I seized my coat, which was weighted by the coppers which I had just transferred to it from the leather bag in which I carried my takings. I hurled it out of the window, and it disappeared into the Thames. The other clothes would have followed, but at that moment there was a rush of constables up the stair, and a few minutes after I found, rather, I confess, to my relief, that instead of being identified as Mr. Neville St. Clair, I was arrested as his murderer.</p>

            <p>"I do not know that there is anything else for me to explain. I was determined to preserve my disguise as long as possible, and hence my preference for a dirty face. Knowing that my wife would be terribly anxious, I slipped off my ring and confided it to the Lascar at a moment when no constable was watching me, together with a hurried scrawl, telling her that she had no cause to fear."</p>

            <p>"That note only reached her yesterday," said Holmes.</p>

            <p>"Good God! What a week she must have spent!"</p>

            <p>"The police have watched this Lascar," said Inspector Bradstreet, "and I can quite understand that he might find it difficult to post a letter unobserved. Probably he handed it to some sailor customer of his, who forgot all about it for some days."</p>

            <p>"That was it," said Holmes, nodding approvingly; "I have no doubt of it. But have you never been prosecuted for begging?"</p>

            <p>"Many times; but what was a fine to me?"</p>

            <p>"It must stop here, however," said Bradstreet. "If the police are to hush this thing up, there must be no more of Hugh Boone."</p>

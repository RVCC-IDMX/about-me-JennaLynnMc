    <h2>CSS Animation</h2>
        <div>  
            <p>CSS is special. It allows HTML elements to be animated without using flash or JavaScript. There's many properties you can choose from to create an animation. Some examples are animation, delay, animation, direction, key frames, etc. To make a CSS animation you need a CSS rule, an element that is able to be animated (HTML), and keyframes. Key frames are really important, it allow elements to hold a style at a certain time. Key frames are needed to specify what you want for an animation. It also allows you to add as many CSS properties as you want! You have to make sure to put the CSS styles inside of the key frames so that the animation will work. Some even think simple animations run poorly under JavaScript. If you want to make simple animations, it's best to use CSS. CSS animations are also good If you don't want to place too much weight on a page. Coding a webpage is a lot of work, it takes hundreds of lines of codes to be able to properly make a website. Having too much elements can create a webpage to slow down, but animating with CSS does not require extra Scripts, making it unlikely to slow down your page. You can create many animations with CSS, some examples include an animated, submit button, text, animations, loading screens and spinners, mouse, hovering transitions, etc. For the example below, I showed an example of hover, responsive texts. Once you hover your mouse over the “Hover Me” text, you can see an animation made right on CSS! You can also make a lot fancier animations, but this is just a simple example. CodePen is a very popular site where users share their own animations. Some animations include JavaScript, and some also don't. This is a very amazing website to look at when you're trying to either get inspiration to make your own animation, or just to use on your site, but don't forget to credit them! There are so many things you can animate and create with CSS, the possibilities are endless! Every single day new CSS animations are being created, and shared all across the world. I think this is an amazing resource! So many animations, or code pens are created and shared every day, making new possibilities for users every single day! You can also share your CSS animations, using CodePen, or any other information sharing website, you don't even have to use one of those, you can simply share your code and results on any platform and It will get attention! It's amazing to share your work and view others works, but as I said above, it is very important to make sure to cite your sources, citing the person you got the code from to avoid any copyright issues! Below, simply cover your mouse over the “Hover Me” text to see the simple hover effect I have created below with CSS!</p>

    <h6>A short Video from my Muse concert!</h6>

    <P>Here is a video from a concert I saw a few weeks ago! One of my favorite hobbies is going to concerts, and just music in general! This is one of my favorite bands named Muse! I also like other bands like Nirvana, Nine Inch Nails, Trivium, Three Days Grace, Disturbed, Korn, etc! I've gone to tons of concerts, and I plan on going to many many more until I am super old! Concerts are definitely one of my favorite things to do, but sadly, it's expensive! Some bands are definitely worth it though!</P>

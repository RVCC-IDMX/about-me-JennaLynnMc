Hi! Im Jenna McIntyre!

[![Netlify Status](https://api.netlify.com/api/v1/badges/1a72d973-cf84-4683-9eda-672ad31cc3c0/deploy-status)](https://app.netlify.com/sites/about-me-jennalynnmc/deploys)

Description: The purpose of my project is to make a site all about me. It is also a good outline site, that I can easily use as a reference when creating other sites in the future. This site is made by the skills I developed in my web development 1 class. From headings to media states, It's all included in this site. There are even some extra things I have added from experimenting with css.

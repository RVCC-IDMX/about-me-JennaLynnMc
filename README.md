Description: The purpose of my project is to make a site all about me. It is also a good outline site, that I can easily use as a refernce when creating other sites in the future. This site is made by the skills I developed in my web development 1 class. From headings to media states, It's all included in this site. There are even some extra things I have added from experimenting with css.
